Databases are hard. Backend development is like a maze with a million different corridors to get lost down. Handlebars are kind of the worst, and I don't like them. Setting up the folder structure wasn't so bad, I've made it a point to stay as close to industry standards as possible. However, like I previously mentioned, setting up a database is like writing a book in a language I don't speak.

I tried to add styling after completing the functionality of the app, but it ultimately broke it, so I took it all out and left everything raw and ugly. However, for the purposes of this assignment, I simply don't care. Burgers can be added and then devoured, and that's all that matters. 

Deploying to Heroku was another obstacle I had completely forgotten about until it was time to turn the assignment in. I struggled for about 45 minutes trying to connect the SQL database to Heroku, and this was with guidance. The provided guides were only nominally helpful but after all the kicking and screaming, I was finally able to deploy. 

I've attached screenshots of my completed application below, and the link to my deployed application can be found here : https://git.heroku.com/stormy-fjord-01940.git
